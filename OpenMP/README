1. make
2. ./blowfish

Explaination:

Before running any version of the code, the user need to generate a test file. The tool to generate a test file is located in the directory filegen.
1.	To use, simply run make and then ./filegen. 
2.	The program ask for the size of the generated file in MB. it is advised that the user generates a file of around 1GB to reliably measure the runtime and throughput of the program. 
3.	By default, this file will be located at ../testfile after generation. Alternatively, the user can move any file he wants to use at the test file to the parent directory and rename it testfile without extensions
.
Instruction for running code:
1.	To use, simply run make and then run ./blowfish
2.	By default, the program encrypts and decrypts the file ../testfile, generated above. Depends on the size of the file, the runtime will be different. The program will then compare the hashes of the input file and decrypted file.
